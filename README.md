# Clinomania

[Clinomania](http://clinomania.surge.sh) is a simple event management web application, that allows organisations to create events and students to browse and sign up for events they are interested in attending. 
This app integrates a calendar that tracks individual user's schedule as they sign up or cancel an event.
This is a Rails API backend, JavaScript frontend solo project.
